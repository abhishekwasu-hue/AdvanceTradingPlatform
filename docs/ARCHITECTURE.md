# Architecture — Phase 1

This repository is being built in phases toward the full platform described in the
project brief (broker-agnostic algo trading for NIFTY 50 cash + F&O, price action,
support/resistance, option chain, risk-managed paper/live execution, backtesting,
strategy builder, dashboard). This first slice implements the **Strategy & Execution
core** end-to-end, vertically, so every layer (indicators → strategy → risk → paper
execution → backtest → API) is real and tested rather than stubbed.

## What exists today

```
backend/
  app/
    core/            # enums, pydantic domain models (Signal, Trade, RiskConfig, ...)
    indicators/       # EMA, SMA, RSI, ATR, ADX/+DI/-DI, Supertrend (pandas/numpy, no TA-Lib dep)
    strategy_engine/   # BaseStrategy, inbuilt multi-timeframe + indicator-based strategies, registry
    risk_engine/       # position sizing, daily loss / trade-count / consecutive-loss gates
    execution/         # PaperBroker (simulated fills + costs), OrderRouter (paper/live gate)
    backtest/          # event-driven backtest engine with HTF resampling
    main.py            # FastAPI app exposing strategies/signals/paper-execute/backtest
  tests/               # pytest coverage for every layer above

## Data flow (current slice)

```
OHLCV bars (per timeframe)
        │
        ▼
 Indicator layer (EMA/RSI/ATR/ADX/Supertrend)
        │
        ▼
 Strategy.analyze() -> Signal (direction, entry, SL, target1/2, RR, score, reasons)
        │
        ▼
 RiskManager.validate_and_size() -> RiskDecision (approve/reject + position size)
        │
        ▼
 OrderRouter (PAPER: PaperBroker simulated fill / LIVE: blocked until a real broker
              adapter is registered — never a silent no-op)
        │
        ▼
 Trade (paper) or BacktestResult (when run through the backtest engine)
```

A strategy can **never** bypass the risk engine: `OrderRouter.execute()` always calls
`RiskManager.validate_and_size()` first, and `ExecutionMode.LIVE` raises
`LiveTradingNotConfigured` until a concrete `BrokerInterface` implementation exists —
per the platform's non-negotiable safety rules (no live order without risk validation,
no live trading while disabled).

## API surface (current slice)

- `GET  /api/strategies` — list every inbuilt strategy (id, name, category, timeframes, params)
- `GET  /api/strategies/{id}` — one strategy's metadata
- `POST /api/strategies/{id}/signal` — run a strategy against supplied OHLCV candles, get a `Signal`
- `POST /api/strategies/{id}/paper-execute` — generate a signal and auto-route it through the
  risk engine + paper broker if it's tradeable
- `POST /api/backtest` — run a strategy over historical OHLCV bars, get a `BacktestResult`
  (trades, win rate, profit factor, drawdown, equity curve, ...)
- `GET  /api/system/health` — liveness

## Design decisions worth flagging

- **No TA-Lib dependency.** Indicators are implemented directly on pandas/numpy with Wilder
  smoothing where the standard defines it (RSI, ATR, ADX). This keeps the service installable
  anywhere without a compiled C dependency, and every indicator has unit tests validating its
  math rather than trusting an opaque library.
- **Strategies are parametrized, not copy-pasted.** The four multi-timeframe combos
  (1m/5m, 1m/15m, 5m/30m, 5m/60m) are one `MTFTrendPullbackScalper` class instantiated four
  times with different timeframe pairs and registered under distinct ids — see
  `app/strategy_engine/mtf_strategy.py`.
- **Signals are never forced.** Every `analyze()` returns a `Signal`; when no setup qualifies
  it comes back as `direction=NO_TRADE` with `reasons` explaining why (matches the platform's
  "the engine must be able to explicitly return NO TRADE" requirement).
- **Backtest resampling is a documented simplification.** Higher-timeframe bars are built by
  resampling the base timeframe and used as soon as their window closes at-or-before the
  current bar — safe for completed HTF bars, but doesn't model intrabar ticks. Noted in
  `run_backtest`'s docstring so it isn't mistaken for tick-accurate simulation.

## What's next (not yet built)

Per the original 40-section brief, still outstanding: broker adapters (Upstox/Zerodha/Angel
One/Fyers/Dhan), price-action/market-structure engine, support/resistance zone engine, option
chain intelligence engine, visual no-code strategy builder, TradingView-style charting UI, the
React/Next.js dashboard and remaining tabs, PostgreSQL/Redis persistence, auth, and Docker/CI
deployment. This slice is the foundation those layers plug into: strategies are already
timeframe- and instrument-agnostic (`symbol` is just a string), so equity/futures/options can
be added by feeding the same `Signal`/`Trade` models once instrument metadata and a real
broker feed exist.
