# WORK_LOG - autonomous overnight run (2026-10-05/06 IST)

Decisions taken without the operator (asleep), with the reason. Rule applied throughout: when in
doubt choose the safe default (feature off, PAPER only, no LIVE change), write it here.

## Context
- Instruction received 22:40 IST: complete BC -> BE -> BD-lite -> "strategist language" PR autonomously
  per `ATP_FULL_EXECUTION_PROMPT`; each PR with tests + green CI + a self-review subagent, then merge
  and move on; stop at "G1" and leave a morning report; nothing LIVE-related.
- **`ATP_FULL_EXECUTION_PROMPT` was not found** in the session uploads or the repository (only the
  master prompt PDFs). The phases are therefore executed from the approved plan of 2026-10-05
  (`docs/MASTER_PROMPT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`, the scratchpad plan) and the names in the instruction:
  * **BC** = deterministic market sentiment (approved plan).
  * **BE** = Telegram inbound with the approved restrictions (whitelist, LIVE web + TOTP only, PAPER and
    reduce/pause only over Telegram).
  * **BD-lite** = the per-symbol market thesis (regime/bias, agreement matrix, bull/base/bear
    scenarios, numbers-check on any LLM narrative) with the reduce-only overlay in **shadow only**
    (recorded, never applied to sizing) and next-day thesis scoring; no deployment setting that can
    change sizing is introduced.
  * **"strategist language" PR** = the Copilot strategist answering fully in the trader's language
    (Marathi/English) for rules-in-words, verdicts, plan lines and the study, plus Marathi/English
    free-text parsing of the strategist request (symbol, style, direction). Interpreted narrowly;
    nothing about order placement.
  * **G1** is not defined in anything available here; the run stops after the four PRs above and this
    log carries the morning report.

## Entries

### BC (PR #51) - self-review findings fixed before merge
- Review found the breadth component dead on Upstox/Zerodha: the bulk `get_quote(list)` wants broker-native
  keys and 4xx'd on plain symbols, silently leaving breadth "missing". Switched to one resolved
  `get_quote_for_symbol` per heavyweight; the test fake now rejects plain-symbol bulk quotes. Also: chain analysis
  inside the try, non-object `SENTIMENT_WEIGHTS` falls back to defaults, worker/route roll back after a failed
  sentiment commit, symbol-filtered memory view keeps the market SENTIMENT row.

### BE - decisions
- Telegram approvals limited to PAPER deployments and PAUSE_DEPLOYMENT / REDUCE_RISK / REVIEW_STRATEGY (the
  approved plan); EXIT_POSITION and anything LIVE get no buttons, and `telegram_allowed()` is re-checked when the
  button is pressed, not only when it is sent.
- The webhook is unauthenticated by nature; it is bound to the tenant's existing TradingView `webhook_token` plus
  Telegram's secret header, with a chat whitelist and a per-chat rate limit, all audited. Flag default off.
- No Telegram command can place, modify or exit an order; free text goes through the read-only Copilot router.

### BE (PR #52) - self-review findings fixed before merge
- BLOCKING: the generic `PUT /api/alert-channels/telegram` accepted `inbound_enabled` / `allowed_chat_ids` /
  `inbound_secret` verbatim, so any trader could switch inbound on with a chosen whitelist and secret, bypassing
  the owner-only endpoint and the flag. The PUT now drops those keys and carries the stored ones over; the webhook
  itself also checks the `telegram_inbound` flag (403 when off). Test added.
- The operator's `ai_copilot` kill flag now binds Telegram `/brief`, `/risk` and free text (it bound only the web).
- Button presses claim the nonce with a conditional UPDATE (and retire the sibling button) so two deliveries cannot
  both decide; the buttons hook can never break the alert drain (own try/except + rollback, nonce rows dropped on a
  failed send); strangers are rate-limited before the audit log and audited at most 5 times per chat per hour;
  command replies are plain text (no HTML double-escaping); transport errors to Telegram become `ok: false`.

### BD-lite - decisions
- Built as "lite" per the night instruction: the thesis, agreement matrix, scenarios, numbers-check and scoring are
  real; the reduce-only overlay is computed and stored as `shadow` only. No deployment setting (`thesis_overlay_mode`
  from the full plan) was introduced - a setting that can change sizing is exactly what "safe default" rules out
  while nobody is watching. A source-scan test keeps execution/risk/guardian code from importing the thesis.
- Scoring uses the symbol's last market-memory read of the next session (0.3% threshold) because that is data the
  platform already has for every tenant; a candle-based scoring can replace it later without a schema change.
- Flag `market_thesis` default off; the worker builds and scores only for tenants with the flag on.

### BD-lite (PR #53) - self-review findings fixed before merge
- Numbers check: a number glued to a prefix (`Rs.26000`, `x26000`) escaped the regex; the lookbehind now only
  avoids re-matching the tail of a number. Factor weights/strengths are no longer "allowed numbers".
- Worker: `news_items` is bound per tenant before the sentiment block (a failure there could have handed the
  previous tenant's classified items to this tenant's thesis); the thesis log line named the wrong job.
- Scenarios fall back to the ATR stand-in when a zone sits on the wrong side of the price (inverted/stale read);
  `capture_daily` ignores reads from an earlier day; the scoreboard counts every scored thesis, not the page;
  stored theses are picked per language; Telegram trailer tells "no read yet" apart from "flag off".
